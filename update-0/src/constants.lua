    ðŸ§® Hex Width Math
    Each pointy-topped hex has:

    radius = 40
    width = âˆš3 Ã— radius â‰ˆ 1.732 Ã— 40 â‰ˆ 69.28

    But adjacent columns donâ€™t sit next to each other fully.
    They shift over by Â¾ of the hex width.

    Horizontal step = hex_width Ã— 0.75 â‰ˆ 69.28 Ã— 0.75 â‰ˆ 51.96
    First column starts at x = 0

    Next 8 columns step by 51.96
    Width â‰ˆ 69.28 + 8 Ã— 51.96 â‰ˆ 69.28 + 415.68 â‰ˆ ~485px
    Thatâ€™s total grid width

    âœ… Final Dimensions
    Letâ€™s round up for padding:

    hex_radius = 40
    hex_width â‰ˆ 69
    hex_height = 80

    So letâ€™s lock in:

    Virtual Width: 550
    Virtual Height: 420

]]

-- size of our actual window
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720

-- size we're trying to emulate with push
VIRTUAL_WIDTH = 550
VIRTUAL_HEIGHT = 360

HEX_RADIUS = 20 -- chamged from 40 to 20 to better fit the screen
